# Bank Management System in C++
 
Project The idea behind **The Bank Management System** is to keep track of customer account information. The user can complete all actions here, including opening an account, depositing money, withdrawing money, checking the balance, viewing information about every account holder, closing an account, and editing an account. This project has all the essential components for a financial system in place.

Classes and C++'s file management facilities are used in this project. The system creates an external file to hold all user data so that we can utilize our pre-existing accounts each time we access the system. The Bank Management System was created utilizing the C++ programming language and a variety of variables and strings.

You must have Dev C++ or Code Blocks installed on your computer in order to run the project. (We advise using this IDE).
